    <p>
    My father worked his career in the oil industry and in 1964-1965 he was posted in Libya. At that time the country was ruled by King Idris and was friendly to western countries, with close ties to the United States and Great Britain.
    Muammar Gaddafi took control of the country in 1969.

      I recently found these photos taken by my father during his time in Libya.
