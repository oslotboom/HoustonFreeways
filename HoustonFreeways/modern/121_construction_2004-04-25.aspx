		A long section of the SH 121 freeway main lanes are under construction, and another long section
		will be awarded in May and June of 2004 estimated at $158 million. Frontage roads for the 
		western section of this portion of SH 121 were constructed in the 1990s and are known as the
		Lewisville bypass.
		<P>
		The area around SH 121 is urbanizing very rapidly. I recently took a drive north of SH 121 and 
		was stunned by the amount of development in progress. Of course, all the new development is 
		spawning traffic, which has made it necessary to build the freeway.
		This facility has always been planned as a freeway (rather than a tollway), and as far as I know 
		this will still be a freeway. However, I wouldn't be surprised if TxDOT tries to 
		toll it since the Transportation Commission is headed by a toll road fanatic.
