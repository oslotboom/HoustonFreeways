		<P>
		<em>Last updated February 15, 2013</em>


		<P>

		The 161 Freeway has been in DFW planning documents since the 1960s. The project was held up in litigation for a long time,
		mainly because of the impacts in Grand Prairie where substantial right-of-way clearance would be needed.
		<P>
		All legal challenges were finally dismissed in February 2000. When I took these photos on March 14, 2004,
		right-of-way clearance was substantially complete.
                

		<P>
		<b>June 6, 2004 Update</b> (new photos at the end of this page)<br>
		The McDonalds and Taco Bell are gone. All the homes in the residential area are now gone, including
		the solitary home I photographed on March 14. The church has been reduced to its structural components
		and its roof. One warehouse has been reduced to its structural shell, and the adjacent warehouse
		looks like it is next in line for dismantlement. The only other structure left is the strip shopping
		center near Interstate 30.
		<P>
        <b>October 2012 Update:</b> The final section of tolled main lanes on SH 161/Bush Turnpike opened on October 15, 2012. The final section was between Interstates 30 and 20 and included the area shown in these photos.
		<!--
		I'm not sure why, but I just love right-of-way clearance. Maybe I have a little Robert Moses blood in me.
		 Of course I wasn't around to see the great right-of-way clearances of
		the 1960s, but I can get a taste of the greatness with the smaller clearances that take place today. Maybe because I move just
		about every year, I view relocation as an opportunity, not something bad. The vast majority (perhaps all) of the people and
		business relocated will move on to better housing/facilities.

		This view shows the alignment of the freeway, with the region of right-of-way clearance indicated.
		The sharp curve in the freeway alignment is to minimize the impact to the area.
		We'll start at the south end of the clearance zone and move northward.

		This view looks north just north of the railroad tracks. This was a residential area with substandard, pre-World War II housing.
