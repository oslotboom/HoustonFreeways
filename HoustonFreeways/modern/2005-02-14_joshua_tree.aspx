		Photos taken on February 14, 2005.
		<P>
		When I arrived at the park, clouds were thick. Fortunately the clouds broke up, enabling some good
		photography. Unfortunately I only brought low-quality film so the color balance leaves a lot to be desired. 
		I did the best I could with Photoshop to restore quality.
		<P>
		Overall, many of the road sections in the park were in severe need of maintenance. The road to lookout point was
		especially bad. Pavement was crumbling 
		along the edges in many cases. In the main area of the park, the road has been repaved and is in good condition.

		This is the main road through the park, Park Road, near the main area of the park just after sunrise. 
		The image two items below is the same view later in the day.
