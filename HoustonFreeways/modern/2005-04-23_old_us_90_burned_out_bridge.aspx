		<P><a href="http://www.texasfreeway.com">TexasFreeway.com</a> will have a comprehensive report on the trip to the
		burned out bridge and the search for the lost city of East Orange, Louisiana. In the meantime, here is a sneak
		peak of what we found.
		<P>
		Old US 90 was the east-west route prior to the construction of Interstate 10. It crossed the Sabine River
		at Orange, TX, leading directly into the center of Orange. The Sabine River bridge was a mechanical design to allow the
		passage of vessels (rotating swing bridge, I think). Just east of the Sabine River in Louisiana US 90 traversed
		through a swampy area and featured a long timber bridge, approximatly 1 mile long. Directly across from Orange, Texas,
		a few structures were constructed along the highway and the area was informally called East Orange, Louisiana.
		<P>
		The Interstate 10 bridge over the Sabine River opened
		circa 1954, rendering the original US 90 as a secondary route. In the 1960s the Sabine River bridge was removed,
		making the old US 90 a dead end. 
		<P>
		In 1973, the timber bridge burned. According to local legend, a suicidal person had a grudge against the highway
		department so he set both ends of the bridge on fire and parked his car in the middle. Whatever the real story, it
		is believed that the fire was set.
		<P>
		The burning of the bridge isolated a section of highway between the bridge and the Sabine River. It became an
		abandoned highway. The end of the accessible highway east of the burned out bridge is now a boat launch into a canal.
		<P>
		We used kayaks to reach the abandoned highway and then searched for remains of the structures. There wasn't
		much left of the structures.

		This is a view of structures at East Orange, Louisiana, looking northeast. Unfortunately I don't have a date on the photo.
		The land in the foreground is Texas, and the other side is Louisiana. The old US 90  crossed 
		the Sabine and proceeded eastward to the bridge, which is now the burned out bridge.
		It looks like the Louisiana side was mostly clear land. Today, it is mostly wooded. The area
		where the structures were is fully wooded.

		This is where the section of Old US 90 begins on the north side of Interstate 10. Old US 90 doesn't cross
		Interstate 10 - it stops on both sides of the Interstate.

		Between the western bridge landing and the Sabine River, the highway is abandoned. This is a typical view
		of the abandoned highway. The asphalt is still in decent condition, but the brush has formed a canopy over the 
		highway in many places.

		Not much remains of the former East Orange, Louisiana. This is the only ruined structure we found. Elsewhere we
