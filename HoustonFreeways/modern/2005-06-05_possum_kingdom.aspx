		Many people may know the term "Possum Kingdom" from the Toadies' 1994 smash hit song with that name.
		But outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area, probably few people realize that Possum Kingdom is a lake about 50 miles west
		of Fort Worth. To the youth of 1994, Possum Kingdom was a place where the guy in the song was trying to
		hook up with a chick. There are other more sinister interpretations of the lyrics, but according to
		web reports the band never endorsed any particular interpretation, leaving the actual intented message unknown.
		<P>
		<P>
		The Toadies' 1994 hit songs remain very popular in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2007. The modern/alternative rock station in Dallas,
		<a href = "http://www.kdge.com/main.html">102.1 The Edge</a>, still gives heavy airplay to the Toadies in 2007, 13 years after the songs
		were released, even though the official radio station format is for "new" music. <em>Possum Kingdom</em>, 
		<em>I Come from the Water</em>, <em>Away</em> and <em>Tyler</em> all receive airplay.
		 (Actually, about a quarter of the music on the Edge is
		1990s music, with heavy Nirvana in the mix as of this writing in May 2007.)
		<P>
		The Toadies slid into obscurity after "Possum Kingdom". In fact, the song is included in an iTunes 
		compilation called "90s One-Hit Wonders". It is in good company with songs like Chumbawamba's "Tubthumping",
		Billy Ray Cyrus's "Achy Breaky Heart", and Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby". 
		But Possum Kingdom Lake remains,
		of course. I decided to check it out.
		<P>
		Possum Kingdom is formed by a dam on the Brazos River. The area around Possum Kingdom lake looks a lot like the terrain northwest of Austin along the Colorado River
		Highland Lakes. The terrain is rocky, there is lots of brush and scrub with a scattering of live oaks,
		moderate-sized hills fill the lanscape, and the area has the look of a transition zone to the the arid
		 mesa country that starts about 100 miles to the west. The dam forming Possum Kingdom lake, completed in 1941, was constructed during
		 the same time period when most of the Colorado River Highland Lakes were built. And finally, the lake looks
		 like a Colorado River lake since it is really more like a wide river than a wide expanse of water.
		 <P>
		 So here are a few pictures of the area. And if you've never heard Possum Kingdom the song, download it 
		 from Itunes to make your knowledge complete. :-)

		This is a view from SH 16 showing the Loving Valley ranch. There's a lot of history in this area.
		Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving settled in this area in the 1850s and started rounding up wild
		longhorn cattle. When they had a sizable herd they went on a cattle drive to get the animals to market.
		The first drive was to Lousiana, followed by a drive to Illinois in 1958 and a drive to Denver in 1860.
		The trail to Denver became known as the Goodnight-Loving trail and was the inspiration for the film
		Lonesome Dove. Loving was killed by Indians in 1867. See the high resolution image to read the historical
		marker.
