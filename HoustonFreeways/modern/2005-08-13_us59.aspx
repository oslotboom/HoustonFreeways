		The project at Montrose to lower the elevated freeway into a new trench is nearing completion.
		The trench is now fully excated and paving will begin soon. The new arched
		bridges at Graustark and Montrose are in place and work is proceeding to build the decks.

		This view is at the Beltway 8 interchange. The trees are a special hybrid known as
		Galveston Eucalyptus. They grow very quickly and become very tall in just a few years. A newsgroup post on
		<a href="http://www.houstonarchitecture.info/haif/index.php?showtopic=4625">HoustonArchitecture.info</a>
		provides more information on this curious landscape tree:
		<br>
		<blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:verdana; font-size:85%;">
		"The story I got when I bought the trees at the nursery near Surfside
was they were originally brought over to Texas to try and clear up
contaminated groundwater. I think they planted a lot of these at a Dow
Chemical plant or some such contaminated place. They drink a lot of
water. ...
<p> The guy [at the nursery] was pretty up front about them. I think
there is only one nursery that sells them. They are calling it
a Galveston Eucalyptus. The drawbacks about them are that the bark and
leaves they shed have no biological enemies therefore the leaves and
bark need to be raked. TxDOT was looking for "plant and forget"-type
trees so I think the Eucalyptus may be up in the air for future
plantings. <P>Other drawbacks that the nursery guy said was the
fire risk [due to oily leaves] and that the trees produce a small fruit in the summer which
could possibly stick on bird's beaks. He said you also don't want
to plant one right next to the foundation of your house. He touched on
the invasive aspect too and said that all the trees he sells are
sterile.<P>They are really cool looking trees though and fast growing."
