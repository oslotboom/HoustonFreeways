		<h3>US 59 at Montrose</h2>
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/59_trench_E_2005-11-28_800.jpg">
		<br>
		Looking east from Mandell, this shows that the new roadway is nearly complete. It looks like it could
		be open to traffic within weeks.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/59_trench_B_2005-11-28_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This zoomed-in view shows the new arches at Graustark and Montrose.

		<h3>Westpark Tollway at Grand Parkway</h2>
		<P>
		The Westpark Tollway is now open to the Grand Parkway, but construction is still in progress at the 
		Grand Parkway (SH 99)/Westpark Tollway Intersection. One direct-connect ramp is part of this phase of construction.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/westpark_at_sh99_2005-11-25_B_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks northeast, showing the Westpark Tollway main lanes under construction and the direct connect ramp.
		
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/westpark_at_sh99_2005-11-25_I_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks north along the Grand Parkway frontage road. The freeway main lanes begin ahead. The new 
		section of Grand Parkway main lanes is now open

		<h3>Grand Parkway East (Baytown)</h2>
		<P>
		This project is building a section of the Grand Parkway (SH 99) in Baytown. SH 99 has absorbed the existing
		Spur 55 from SH 146 to FM 1405. The new construction is from FM 1405 to FM 565. I did not see any work between
		FM 565 and Interstate 10. That will be a crucial missing link.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/grand_parkway_east_D_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		West of FM 1405, the alignment follows Fisher Road. There is an overpass at the railroad.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/grand_parkway_east_H_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		A closer view of the overpass.
		
		
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/grand_parkway_east_J_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		West of the overpass, the Parkway veers northward, away from Fisher Road. It looks like it will be a single
		carriageway going northward.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/grand_parkway_east_B_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This is at FM 565 (visible on the left). This appears to be the end of the current project.

		<h3>NASA 1 Bypass Freeway</h2>
		<P>
Work is proceeding very slowly on this project. I don't know what the holdup is.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/nasa1_C_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks east along NASA 1 (visible on the left), showing the piers for the bypass. There has 
		been little progress at this location for about a year.
		
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/nasa1_E_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks east at SH 3, showing the piers for the overpass.
		
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/nasa1_F_2005-11-27_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks west from SH 3, showing the alignment of the bypass. The ground has not even been disturbed yet.

		<h3>Katy Freeway</h2>
		<P>
See the <a href="http://www.katyfreeway.org/construction_photos/construction_photos_main.html">official web site<a> for
more photos.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2005-11/i10_bw8_sb_feeder_bypass_2005-11-28_800.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks north along the BW southbound feeder. You can see the structure for the feeder road
		bypass ramp, which will be a first in Texas.
