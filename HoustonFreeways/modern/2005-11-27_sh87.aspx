		<em>Last updated November 27, 2005</em>
		<P>

		Previously I reported on SH 87, the washed-out coastal highway east of Galveston. <br>

		<p>
		Hurricane Rita existed from September 17-26, 2005. For a brief time it was one of the most powerful storms in 
		recorded history. Fortunately it fizzled and then veered away from Houston and Galveston. It did impart
		a soft hit on the section of coast where SH 87 once existed. So, on November 27, 2005, I decided to take a trip to see how much
		erosion occurred on this section of coastline.
		<P>
		There was some obvious decay of the beach and vehicle trail since my last visit in January 2005, but I would
		rate the erosion as minor. Only a minimal impact on the section of coast east of High Island. I didn't drive
		all the way to Sabine, where the impact could have been greater since it was closer to point where the eye of the
		storm hit.
		<P>
		It has become more difficult to traverse the section east of High Island in a vehicle. In January 2005 we did it in an ordinary
		passenger vehicle. I don't think that would be possible anymore. I was in a high-riding F-150 truck, and 
		it was a risky drive since I had only two-wheel drive. Ideally, this section should be driven with a high-riding
		4-wheel drive vehicle. I managed to get stuck in the sand once, but fortunately I had a shovel with me.
		<P>

		<br>
		This is the barrier on SH 87 at the TX 124 intersection at High Island. It sustained minimal or negligible
		damage from Rita (it was already damaged before the storm).

		<br>
		There is definitely more sand on the road than there was before Rita. Here we see the last bit of 
		pavement before the highway section ahead is engulfed in sand.
		<P>

		<br>
		Further ahead there is a section of intact pavement. The waves are reaching the edge of the pavement, so
		it probably won't last long.

		<em>(Click for high resolution)</em> The road becomes visible again. Here we see the edge of the pavement,

		<br>
		When I reached this point I decided to stop since the terrain ahead was muddy and it would be a risky drive.
