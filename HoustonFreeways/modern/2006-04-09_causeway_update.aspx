		<br>
		This is the I-45 southbound main lanes. Traffic has been diverted to the former northbound structure
		and demolition of the southbound bridge is just underway.

		<br>
		Apparently there is lead containment work in progress. I assume it is on the paint on the steel girders
		in the center span.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-04-09_causeway/IMG_0999_i45_causeway_looking_along_sb_span_2006-04-11.jpg">

		This view looks along the former southbound span. Southbound traffic is now on the former northbound structure
		to the immediate left, and the new structure with northbound traffic is on the far left.

		<br>
		Here is another plaque on the southbound span from 1968. I don't know what kind of work was done at that time.
		The reference to "Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works" suggests it may have been some kind
		of emergency repair.

		<br>
		<em>(Click for high resolution)</em>Here is the plaque on the former northbound structure, which was constructed from 1936 to 1938. 
		It was originally a drawbridge, and the drawbridge section was replaced by a high level span which
		opened on April 29, 1964.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-04-09_causeway/IMG_1049_i45_causeway_new_bridge.jpg">
		<br>
		Here is the new bridge with northbound traffic on the left side. The pavement straight ahead will
		be used for southbound traffic during construction, and this entire structure will be for 
		northbound traffic when the job is complete. Notice the artistic lighting fixture.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-04-09_causeway/IMG_1048_new_nb_pavement_2006-04-11.jpg">
