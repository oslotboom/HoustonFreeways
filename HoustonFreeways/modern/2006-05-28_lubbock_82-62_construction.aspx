		This project is building an all-new freeway on the alignment of US 82/62 in west and southwest Lubbock. It looks like all contracts
		for frontage roads and freeway main lanes are awarded from just west of I-27 to west of Loop 289. The last remaining contract to be awarded appears to 
		be the interchange at I-27. It is listed as a $55 million project in TxDOT's project listing.
		<P>
		A substantial amount of right-of-way clearance was needed to build this freeway.
		<P>
		This freeway is named the <a href="http://www.twu.edu/twhf/tw-sharp.htm">Marsha Sharp</a> freeway. She is the head coach of the Texas Tech
		women's basketball team. It seems strange to name a freeway after a women's basketball coach. You would think that an arena or athletic facility
		would be named in her honor. However, you usually need to donate millions of dollars to get a university building named after you, but
		no money is needed for the freeway naming.
		<P>
		Photos start at I-27 and proceed westward.

		<br>
		This sign is along US 82/82 just west of I-27. The future is going to arrive soon.

		<P>

		<br>
		This is the existing US 82/62 going westbound just west of I-27. It is a four-lane urban street with a center turn lane. For its
		entire length in this corridor the existing highway is a four- or six-lane urban street with a center turn lane.

		This view looks east, showing Interstate 27 in the background with cleared right-of-way for the future interchange in the foreground.
		The TxDOT web site lists the interchange as a $55 million project.

		<br>
		Just ahead is the concrete batch plant. For some reason all the Granite concrete trucks had their hoods open on the Sunday of Memorial Day
		weekend.

		<br>
		This shows the concrete of the future eastbound main lanes. The concrete looks like it is about 10 inches thick, definitely not as
		thick as the 15" thick pavement used in Houston.

		<P>

		<br>
		We are now approaching Texas Tech University. In the background is the football stadium. This view looks west with the rebar
		for the future westbound frontage road in the foreground.

		<br>
		This view looks east from University, which is the eastern boundary of Texas Tech University.
		The freeway
		will be depressed in a trench as it passes through Texas Tech University. Here we can see excavation for the trenched freeway.
