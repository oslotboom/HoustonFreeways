		<div style="width:500px;">
		<P>
		This is a $100 million project to convert approximately 9 miles of SH 6 south of College Station to a freeway. The existing facility
		is a four-lane highway, mostly undivided but with some sections having a center turn lane. The right-of-way for the freeway corridor is very wide, around 450 feet, so this will be
		nice freeway. The project includes frontage roads for the entire length.
		<P>
		When this project is complete, the highways from Houston to College Station will be about 75% freeway. The only non-freeway section is between
		Hempstead and Navasota, which is a 4-lane divided highway without any traffic lights. Students going to Texas A&amp;M may not realize how good things
		are compared to the dark ages from 1985 to 1989 when I attended Texas A&amp;M. 
		<P>
		In 1985, the US 290 main lanes stopped at Beltway 8 in Houston, so traffic was on the frontage roads with numerous signals. There was a short section of freeway at
		FM 1960, and then about 10 miles of divided highway with a couple traffic signals. East of Hockley US 290/SH 6 became a 4-lane undivided with 
		at least one signal in Hockley. The highway remained 4-lane undivided all the way to Hempstead with numerous signals, speed zones, and the
		radar traps at Prairie View. Going through Hempstead was a 30 mph zone with numerous lights and the dreaded turn which often backed up.
		North of Hempstead SH 6 was a two-lane highway all the way to Navasota. The 4-lane divided highway was completed around 1986 or 1987. The section
		from Navasota to College Station is the same today, but of course is being upgraded to a freeway now.
