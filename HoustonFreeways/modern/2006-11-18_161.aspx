		Photos taken July 16 (Interchange) and November 18 (frontage roads), 2006.
		<P>
		Work is proceeding quickly on the frontage roads through Grand Prairie. The section just south and north of Interstate 30 is the
		segment that generated controversy and litigation, holding up the project for around 20 years. Now work is proceeding quickly and construction of the
		tolled main lanes will follow soon after the frontage roads.

		<br>
		Looking south at Pioneer Parkway. The section south of Pioneer Parkway is a separate construction contract which is now nearly complete.
		Photos of this project from  <a href="http://houstonfreeways.com/modern/2006-05-21_161_frontage_road_construction.aspx">May 2006</a> are on a separate page.
		We will proceed north from Pioneer Parkway, where work is just getting underway.

		<br>
		Driver's view at Marshall. The two-lane asphalt road will be replaced by the frontage roads and eventually wiped out by the main lanes.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2421_161_structure_along_road_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		In the above photo you can see a strange structure on the right. (Possibly a fire department training facility?)  Here is a closer view. The new northbound frontage road comes very close to it.
		I'm guessing that the structure will be demolished.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2423_161_at_dickey-robinson_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		At Dickey/Robinson road we get a good view of the right-of-way of the new facility.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2426_161_sign_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		Although the existing road is only two lanes, it has been signed as "West Freeway" for some time.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2427_161_s_of_jefferson_looking_n_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		Looking north just south of Jefferson, which runs alongside the railroad.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2428_161_nb_approaching_jefferson_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		Driver's view on the existing road, approaching Jefferson. This location will eventually be the northbound main toll lanes.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2429_161_at_jefferson_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		The existing road stops at Jefferson. Ahead the freeway blazes right-of-way on new location. For 2004 photos of the 
		right-of-way clearance, click <a href="http://houstonfreeways.com/modern/161_row_clearance_200403-14.aspx">here</a>.

		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2407_161_looking_north_at_dalworth_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		Looking north at Dalworth. The highway cuts through a lower-tier residential area, and this section was one of the main sources of controversy
		and litigation that delayed the project.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2410_161_airbus_a340_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		The freeway is on the approach path for DFW Airport. When I took the photos in mid-afternoon, numerous flights from Europe were arriving
		including this Lufthansa Airbus A340.
		<P>

		<br>
		This view looks northwest with 19th Street crossing ahead. Highway 161 curves to run parallel to 19th Street.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2434_161_drivers_view_on_19th_nb_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		This is a driver's view northbound on 19th, showing where Highway 161 merges in from the east.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2406_161_veering_away_from_19th_2006-11-18.jpg">

		This view looks north at the concrete batch plant just south of Interstate 30.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2435_161_at_i30_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		At Interstate 30. A five-level interchange will be built here. The will be the first interchange in Texas where the frontage roads are on the third level.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2368_161_at_i30_2006-11-04.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks east along Interstate 30, showing where the Highway 161 toll lanes will cross underneath. (Photo taken November 5, 2006)
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2438_161_n_of_i30_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		North of Interstate 30 the right-of-way is being cleared.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_2440_161_at_carrier_parkway_2006-11-18.jpg">
		<br>
		This view looks north at 19th Street and Carrier Parkway, which is the end of the active construction project. Here Highway 161 will veer
		away from 19th Street onto a new alignment. Ahead is park which was another source of controversy. Remediation parkland is being purchased
		to offset the impact of Highway 161.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_1485_161_at_183_looking_s-se_2006-07-16.jpg">
		<br>
		Further north at SH 183 (Airport Freeway), work on the interchange is nearing completion. There photos were taken on July 16, 2006. This view looks east-southeast
		along SH 183.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_1486_161_looking_e_along_183_2006-07-16.jpg">

		<br>
		This shows the Highway 161 main lanes. This project is being built with conventional (gasoline tax) funds, but I don't know if these lanes
		will be free or tolled. South of this interchange the main lanes will definitely be tolled.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/2006-11-18_161/IMG_1497_161_at_183_161_main_lanes_2006-07-16.jpg">
