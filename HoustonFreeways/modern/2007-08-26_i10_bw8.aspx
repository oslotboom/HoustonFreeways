		There photos were taken on the weekend of August 25 and 26, 2007. There was a complete closure of the westbound main lanes
		to allow placement of beams for a ramp.
		<P>
		Right now we can still see quite a bit of the original ramps, which are destined for demolition in the upcoming weeks.
		The new ramps being built alongside the old ones.
