		<P>
		The Katy Freeway is nearly complete! In fact, the freeway was striped to its final configuration from Blalock to Loop 610 on the weekend of 
		July 12.
        </P>
        <p>
        I took these photos July 6. The eastbound main lanes were already striped to the final configuration in the section to be opened.
        At Beltway 8/Sam Houston Tollway, six of eight ramps are complete and open. The remaining two ramps are nearly complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        These photos start at Beltway 8 and proceed east toward Loop 610.
        </p>

		<br>
	    This is on the southwest side of the interchange, looking east along I-10. In the foreground, work on the two remaining unfinished ramps
	    is shown.

		<br>
	    All of the original five-level interchange has been demolished except for three piers. This view shows a remaining pier on the northwest
	    side of the interchange. I think the technical name for this type of pier is a "straddle bent". See it while you can, because it will be demolished soon.
		<P></P>
