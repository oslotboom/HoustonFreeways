		<div style="width:800px; font-family:serif;">
		<span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold; color:Red;">UPDATE:</span> The Blue Water Highway was fully rebuilt and opened in its original location and configuration on May 4, 2009. 
		<br />
		<P>
		When category 2 Hurricane Ike hit the upper Texas coast on September 12 and 13, 2008, the most severe destruction occurred on Bolivar Peninsula
		east of Galveston. However, State Highway 87 on Bolivar Peninsula sustained minimal damage.
		</p>
		<p>
		The most severe highway damage caused by Hurricane Ike occurred 50 miles southwest of Bolivar on the coastal highway between San Luis pass (at the southwest
		tip of Galveston Island) and the beachside community of Surfside near Freeport/Lake Jackson. This highway is officially County Road 257 and is named the 
		Blue Water Highway. About 2.3 miles of the Blue Water Highway were totally destroyed and another 3.5 miles
		sustained serious damage.
		<P>
		Although it may have been better to relocate the highway further away from the beach, any relocation would have required lengthy environmental studies with potential high
		costs due to wetland impacts. From a regulatory and disaster recovery perspective, the only quick option was to rebuild the highway exactly where it was. Washed-out sections
		were refilled with fill dirt, and the $3.5 million reconstruction job was finished on May 4, 2009. The Houston Chronicle reported that another $38 million in work was planned
		to protect the highway from future storm surges. In some places the highway is now on the beach.

        These photos start just east of Surfside and proceed northeast to San Luis Pass.

		<br>
        The first warning sign appears at the eastern end of the Surfside community. Here the highway is intact but was obviously covered by sand during the storm.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/fm3005/IMG_4624_20081019_fm3005_destruction.jpg">
		<br>
        This type of damage is typical just east of Surfside, with the storm surge washing out the ocean-side (eastbound) lane, but leaving the westbound side intact.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/fm3005/IMG_4623_20081019_fm3005_destruction.jpg">

        Ahead is the last cluster of beach houses, with more closure signs and a big chunk of the highway missing.
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/fm3005/IMG_4619_20081019_fm3005_destruction.jpg">
		<br>
		Here are some beach houses. Damage was generally low to moderate in Surfside, compared to Bolivar where whole neighborhoods where wiped off the map.
		However, many Surfside houses are now standing in newly created pools of water, like the two shown above.
        
		<P>
		<img src="<%=System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ImagePath"] %>images/fm3005/IMG_4618_20081019_fm3005_destruction.jpg">

        This next warning sign informs motorists that they are traveling at their own risk.

        Ahead is an intact section of highway. This is what the entire highway segment ahead looked like before the storm.....but not anymore!

        The first major washout is ahead. You can see how traffic is diverted to a makeshift dirt road on the inland side of the highway.

		<br>
        Washout. You can see how the storm created new tidal ponds which allowed the water to reach the road.

		<br>
        Here we can see the highway alignment is on the edge of the beach, and the highway was totally destroyed by the storm.
        Any rebuilding effort will need to move the alignment further inland.

        The beach remains wide, smooth, and firmly packed, just like it was before the storm. In fact, you could drive 60 mph on the beach if you wanted to. 
        Here some vehicles are proceeding along the beach detour.

		This damage is a long way inland from the coast. I'm guessing that the drainage ditch on the side of the highway became a conduit for the storm surge flow,
