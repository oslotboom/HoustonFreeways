		The $1.8 billion <a href="http://my290.com/">US 290 expansion</a> is the largest highway construction project in Houston in the 2013-2017 period. 
            (The Grand Parkway sections F and G is longer at 38 miles long but costs less, $1.1 billion).
		</p>
            According to a October 3, 2014, <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/transportation/article/Ramp-opening-soon-to-directly-connect-U-S-290-to-5799346.phpww?cmpid=gplus-premium&t=b0a8a4f641bfe1217f&cmpid=email-premium&t=b0a8a4f641fda33e64#/0">article</a>
            in the Houston Chronicle, the cost for right-of-way and utility relocation at the Loop 610/US 290 interchange was $220 million. (No cost figures were available for the rest of the corridor.)
		<p>
		TxDOT attempted to minimize the right-of-way acquisition for US 290 after the huge and costly <A href="2005-04-23_i10_row_clearance.aspx">clearance</A> needed 
            for the Interstate 10 West Katy Freeway expansion which completed in October 2008. There are only two areas of substantial clearance in the US 290 project,
            the largest along Loop 610 where the interchange with US 290 is being expanded and a second area just west of the Beltway 8 interchange. Between Loop 610 and Beltway 8, the clearance
            is generally a narrow strip less than 50 feet wide which requires some displacements but much smaller than the scale of the Katy Freeway expansion.

		Along the West Loop
		</div>
        <p>This is the area with the most extensive clearance. Between Interstate 10 and the US 290, about 0.8 miles long, a strip about 300 feet wide was cleared along the west side Loop 610.
            The buildings displaced were low-rise (mostly single floor) office buildings, warehouses and industrial structures.

		<br>
        (3-Feb-2013) This view shows construction on the new southbound frontage road with the warehouse building in the background. It took a very long time to clear the warehouse - I'm assuming
            there was litigation in the condemnation proceedings.

		Northwest Mall, at the Intersection of US 290 and Loop 610.

        The structure of Northwest Mall was unaffected, but Northwest Mall did lose a wide swatch of its parking lot. Properties alongside the freeway at Northwest Mall were cleared.

        Before the project there was about 200 feet of parking lot to the left of the Macy's building on the right. Now the frontage road narrowly misses the Macy's building. (I don't know if Macy's actually occupies this building anymore - I think they vacated.)
