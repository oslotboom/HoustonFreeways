		<P>

		The demolition of US 59 (the Southwest Freeway) and Spur 527 began the night of Friday February 13 after a 
		favorable court ruling the preceding Monday. The connection ramp to Spur 527, commonly called the
		"downtown split", was gone by Saturday February 14. Traffic was shifted to the north side of the
		US 59 elevated structure and demolition of the south side of the elevated structure began. As of February
		27, demolition was about 50% complete.

		(2004-02-13) This view shows the Spur 527 connection ramp in its final hours. The excavator-crawlers on the ramp are
		equipped with jackhammers which broke up the concrete. The noise from the jackhammers was deafening. It's a good thing the
		demolition was a one-night event, otherwise I think there would have been a revolt in the nearby neighborhoods.
