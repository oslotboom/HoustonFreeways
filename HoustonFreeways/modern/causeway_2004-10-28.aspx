		Construction is progressing quickly. The new bridge will feature 8 traffic lanes on a 148-foot-wide deck.
		The main span over the intracoastal waterway will be a cast-in-place concrete box girder with a span
		of 300 feet.	
		<P>	
		Both existing structures (northbound and southbound) will be demolished and entirely removed to 3 feet
		below the mud line. The northbound lanes were originally opened in 1938 with a drawbridge. In 1961
		the southbound lanes were opened with a high clearance bridge over the intracoastal waterway. 
		Then the drawbridge section of the 1938 bridge was removed and replaced with a high-level span.
		Both structures are showing their age, especially the 1961 structure which was built with lightweight
		(and deteriorating) precast components.

		Looking from the mainland towards Galveston Island. Notice that a special railroad bridge and crane
		bridge have been constructed alongside the actual bridge piers. It looks like the bridge beam sections
		will be conveyed via locomotive on the railroad bridge, and the crane will grab the beam and place it.
