		The section under construction is between BW 8 and SH 6. These views start at SH 6 and proceed northward. For a map, see <A href="fort_bend_2003-10-15.aspx">October 2003 views</a>.

		This view looks north at SH 6. The tollway main lanes will be in a trench, which was filled with water when I took this photo. I don't think the main lanes under SH 6 will be built at this time, since SH 6 is the start of the toll road.

		The Fort Bend Parkway passes through the old Blue Ridge oil field, which exists around a salt dome in the area. There is still a salt mine nearby. You can smell oil in the air. Since I worked for oilfield services company Schlumberger for 7 years, I definitely like the smell. This is a view of an active stripper well right next to the parkway right-of-way.

		There are also some abandoned oil tanks next to the right-of-way.
