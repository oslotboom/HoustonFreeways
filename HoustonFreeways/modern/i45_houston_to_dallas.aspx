		I've been driving this 250-mile route frequently this year. I like this section of interstate. It's basically
		nonstop 70 mph with no cities from Conroe to Corsicana, and it's also fairly scenic. In fact, I rate it as the second
		most scenic section of Interstate in Texas, after I-10 northwest of San Antonio. The later sections of I-45 to be built,
		from Madisonville to south of Corsicana, are very well designed with smooth grades and gentle curves. It is 
		sooooooo much better than I-35 from Dallas to Austin.	
		<P>	
		This section of Interstate crosses through four distinct ecological zones: the coastal plain, piney woods,
		oak woods and prairies, and blackland prairie. There aren't very many non-mountainous interstates where you can cross
		through so many distinct zones in about 150 miles. 
		<P>
		</div>
		The first sections of Interstate 45 opened as US 75 from Dallas to Corsicana in the 1950s. This section was recently
		rebuilt to a 6-lane facility. The other sections opened as listed below.

		<P>
		According to a report in <em>Texas Highways</em> magazine, the final section of US 75 from 
		Buffalo to Streetman was extremely dangerous. Heavy traffic and the substandard design of US 75
		contributed to a high fatality rate. The completion of the final section in 1971 was 
		widely hailed as a huge safety improvement on the Texas highway system.
		
		<P>
		 These photos were taken on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, which is why the traffic was so heavy.
		 Normally this is a pleasant drive with plenty of highway for each motorist.

		<br>
		Between Centerville and Buffalo. Notice the concrete pavement. This section opened in 1969 and the concrete 
		pavement is in nearly mint condition. No spalling, and only occasional patches in the right lane.
		I always wonder why this concrete has held up so well for 35 years, whereas other sections have been
		overlaid with asphalt ever since I can remember.

		Pavement rehabilition is in progress near Corsicana. I was driving on fresh new concrete when I took this photo.
		Reconstruction has been in progress from Dallas to south of Corsicana since the late 1980s. From Corsicana

		This is the last section of original highway north of Corsicana. Work is in progress to rebuild it
		and widen it to 6 lanes. North of Corsicana the visual quality deteriorates substantially with lots
		of junky buildings lining the road, like the adult video establishment in this photo. Also, we
		have moved out of the oak forest zone and we are now in the blackland prairie zone, so there are no trees.
